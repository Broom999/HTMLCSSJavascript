    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p><img src="images/Owner.png" width="400px" legth="400px"><br>
    Nestled in the heart of a town that once thrived on old-world butchery and smokehouse tradition, Sandvich's was born from a love of pork—and a reverence for its many forms. Founded by a third-generation pitmaster whose grandfather cured meats in a stone cellar and whose mother ran a roadside diner famous for her pulled pork sliders, Sandvich's is more than a restaurant—it's a shrine to swine. The name Sandvich's is a playful nod to both the humble sandwich and the hearty Slavic roots of its founder, whose family recipes blend Eastern European techniques with Southern soul. From slow-roasted pork belly glazed in plum reduction to crispy schnitzel tucked into brioche buns, every dish tells a story of migration, memory, and meat. The restaurant’s walls are lined with vintage butcher tools, faded family photos, and hand-drawn diagrams of pig anatomy—each marking a chapter in the journey from farm to flame. Guests don’t just eat here; they enter a world where pork is elevated to art. Whether you're biting into a smoked shoulder bánh mì or sipping bone broth infused with fennel and garlic, Sandvich’s invites you to taste the legacy of a family that believes pork isn’t just food—it’s heritage.</p>
